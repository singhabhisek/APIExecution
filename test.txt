Step-by-Step Explanation
Start (A):

The process begins here. This is the entry point of the flowchart.
Load Application Dropdown from app.config JSON (B):

The application loads a dropdown menu populated with options from a configuration file in JSON format. This file likely contains details about various services available for the user to select.
Fetch App Configuration from JSON file (C):

The application retrieves additional configuration details from the JSON file to understand how to operate with the selected services.
Update Data Table with Relevant Service Details (D):

The application updates a data table displayed to the user with details of the services available based on the configuration loaded.
Submit Button Click (E):

The user can click the "Submit" button to proceed with the selected services. There is also an option to click the "Reset" button (F) to clear selections.
Is Any Service Selected? (G):

A decision point where the application checks if the user has selected any services.
Yes: If a service is selected, it proceeds to fetch user role information.
No: If no service is selected, it shows an error message prompting the user to select a service (I).
Fetch User Role Info - Admin or Normal User (H):

The application determines the user's role (Admin or Normal User) to apply specific rules and limitations.
Check Max Operations Allowed Based on Role (J):

The application checks how many services the user can operate based on their role.
Exceeds: If the selected services exceed the maximum limit (e.g., 10 for normal users), it shows an alert (K).
Within Limit: If the number of selected services is within the limit, it proceeds to execute the services (L).
Execute Services in Batches of 5 Operations in Parallel (L):

The application starts executing the selected services, breaking them down into batches of 5 to manage performance and reliability.
Invoke Python Backend Code to Execute Web Services (M):

The application calls a Python backend service to perform the actual execution of the web services.
Check if All Selected Services Executed (N):

After invoking the services, the application checks whether all selected services have been executed successfully.
Yes: If all services have executed, it shows a confirmation message (O).
No: If not all services have executed, it loops back to continue executing the remaining services (L).
Show Alert: Max Limit of 10 Services for Normal Access (K):

This alert informs users if they try to select more than the allowed number of services based on their role.
Show Error Message: Select a Service (I):

This message prompts the user to select at least one service if none is selected.
Update Results in Table (Q):

Once all services are executed successfully, the application updates the results in a table format.
Update Counts and Enable Results Button to View Responses (Q1):

The application refreshes any counts and enables a button for users to view the detailed responses of the executed services.
Enable Excel Export Options (R):

Users are given options to export the results to an Excel file.
User Clicks Export? (S):

Another decision point asking if the user wants to export the results.
Yes: If the user clicks export, it will export the results to Excel with the selected checkboxes (T).
No: If not, the process moves to the end (U).
Reset All Items (V):

If the user clicks the reset button, the application clears all selections, allowing the user to start over.
End (U):

This node signifies the end of the process, where no further actions will be taken.
